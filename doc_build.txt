we are trying to have the same .js wasm wrapper as modyfi, still can't figure out what version it is as
 the source for wasm-pack also rely on other cargo for the genrating of the .js wasm wrapper itself

wasm-pack --version 
0.13.0  is latest but don't have __wbg_init that mody uses it has __wbg_set_wasm instead 
C:\work\wgpu\wgpu-compute-toy\ts-shell\lib_0.13

cargo uninstall wasm-pack
cargo install wasm-pack --version 0.12.0
